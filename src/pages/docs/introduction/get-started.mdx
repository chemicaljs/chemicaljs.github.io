Chemical is a package that takes care of setting up a proxy on both the backend and client.

This can be great for people with less experience looking to create a proxy site,
or just to have a clean, simple codebase.

To setup Chemical, create a server and import the client scripts. Chemical components is an even easior way to setup Chemical with minimal scripting.
