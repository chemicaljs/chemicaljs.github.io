# Set Store

Saves a valued used by Chemical in localStorage. Stores will need to be enabled for transport and wisp in [Setup](/docs/client/setup/) and the rest in the [Input Component](/docs/components/input/).

You can set: "transport", "wisp", "service", "autoHttps", "searchEngine"

```js
chemical.setStore("service", "rammerhead")
```

You can listen for a change from `chemicalStoreChange`.

```js
window.addEventListener("chemicalStoreChange", function ({ detail }) {
    console.log(detail.key, detail.value);
});
```
