# Loaded

The client script can take a few seconds to load due to first, loading scripts, than setting the transport, and last registering the service worker.

You can use `chemical.loaded` to check if Chemical has loaded or wait until they have loaded.

```js
window.addEventListener("chemicalLoaded", function(e) {
    console.log("Chemical is loaded: ", chemical.loaded)
});
```
